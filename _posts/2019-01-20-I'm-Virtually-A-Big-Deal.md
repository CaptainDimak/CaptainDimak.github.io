# How do you make something simple, but awe inspiring in VR?

## In collaboration with artist and glassblower Ji Huang.
Last I heard, he was at the Royal College of Art in London.

Built from scratch in Unity using 3D scans of myself and Ji. We found that the sheer sense of scale was the most important thing to use to get reactions out of testers. In-experience walls that approximately match the scale of the real world room slowly move out to reveal miles-tall, contorted scans in a marble texture.

Showcased at the Jacob Lawrence Gallery in May 2017.
