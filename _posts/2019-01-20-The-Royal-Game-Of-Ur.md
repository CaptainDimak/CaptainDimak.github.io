# Bringing a 4000+ year old board game back to life.

I was inspired by a [video from the British Museum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I) to try and make my own version of The Royal Game of Ur. The only versions available for purchase were limited runs of museum replicas, stuff from Etsy, and vintage versions on eBay. I created a faithful but modernized version that is simple to fabricate using a laser cutter.
