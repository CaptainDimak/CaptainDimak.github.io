# Making a personal-use printer ready for a makerspace.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeID %}

The CoMotion MakerSpace adds a number of new printers every year. Initially, the FlashForge Finders we purchased (only two to start) were going to be just for showcases and travelling events. Unfortunately, we fell a little bit in love with the simplicity and reliability of these little machines. After we pulled the trigger on four more, we realized that small issues like getting to the USB slot, or the puny integrated spool holder, were making the printers quite difficult to use en masse.

To combat this, I created a number of 3D printed modifications to bring the Finders up to par. The printers are now significantly easier to use, both for users and from a maintenance standpoint! STLs are available below.
